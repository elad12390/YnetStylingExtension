# YnetStylingExtension
Wanted to change the styling of the ynet website, for personal use, with ublock origin it really works good :)
to use it enable developer mode in chrome extensions, clone this repo and load the folder into chrome and that's it, it should look different
example of it working : https://imgur.com/a/KC74wAi
